# Welcome

This wiki hosts all kind of information about selfhosted applications, network stuff, hardware, and so on... Basically speaking, it is about homelabs.

## Technical details
The underlying projects this wiki is build upon are [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). MkDocs provides an easy way to create a static website using Markdown files as a content source.

The wiki pages are hosted on a Github repository and each `push` to the main branch triggers a _build_ using webhooks and a quick and dirty Python script that takes care of the webserver stuff.

## Disclaimer
The information on this wiki are by no means "best practice" or professional guides. It is a place to note down how we do stuff and exchange information. Articles will likely change a lot as we always learn new things and are keen to improve.

We do not take responsibility or liability for any damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequental damages arising out of the use or inability to use the information provided.
